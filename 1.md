WHAT IS OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects,” which contain data and methods. It helps in organizing complex programs by modeling real-world entities. The main aim of OOP is to increase code reusability, maintainability, and scalability. The key features of OOP include encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. Encapsulation binds data and functions together, while abstraction hides implementation details. Inheritance allows one class to acquire properties of another, promoting code reuse. Polymorphism enables a single interface to represent different data types or behaviors. OOP focuses on objects rather than procedures, making it more intuitive and modular. It improves data security by controlling access through access specifiers. Overall, OOP simplifies problem-solving by breaking programs into smaller, manageable components.

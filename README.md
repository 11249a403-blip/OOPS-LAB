# 🎓 Object Oriented Programming with C++ – Lab Record

This repository contains all **21 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** experiments implemented in **C++**, following standard lab structure:
- **Aim**
- **Algorithm**
- **Code**
- **Output**
- **Result**

Each experiment file is named according to its number (e.g., `1.cpp`, `2.cpp`, etc.).

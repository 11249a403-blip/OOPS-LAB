# 🎓 Object-Oriented Programming Laboratory – C++  
**Department of Computer Science and Engineering**  
**Kanchi University**

---

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains all **26 OOP Lab experiments** implemented in **C++**.  
Each program demonstrates a specific concept of Object-Oriented Programming such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading, templates, file handling, and exception handling.

Each experiment includes:
- **AIM**
- **ALGORITHM**
- **CODE**
- **OUTPUT**
- **RESULT**

All files are named according to their experiment number (e.g., `1.cpp`, `2.cpp`, … `26.cpp`).

## 🧑‍💻 How to Compile and Run

### Using Command Line:
```bash
g++ <filename>.cpp -o output
./output

EXAMPLE:
g++ 5.cpp -o exp5
./exp5

Using VS Code / Code::Blocks:

Open the .cpp file.

Press Run or Ctrl+F9 to execute.

🏁 Result

All 26 programs were successfully compiled, executed, and verified.
The experiments effectively demonstrate the major principles and applications of Object-Oriented Programming in C++.
